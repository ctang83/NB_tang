# Online book and Dashboard

## 网络抓取和网络数据传输  

- R包 rvest: Easily Harvest (Scrape) Web Pages [参考手册](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rvest/index.html)  
数据抓取两大阶段：网页获取和网页解析  
     R主要靠两个包，网页获取是RCurl，解析是靠XML  
python也对应两个包，网磁获取是requests，解析是BeautifulSoup

- R包 Rfacebook: 提取facebook的数据

- XML(eXtensible Markup Language)可扩展标记语言, 是一种结构化数据交换语言, 可描述非常复杂的数据结构, 常用于传输和存储数据

## Building online book(Bookdown)

This tutorial will show us easiest way to build an online book (or a book-style website) through RStudio and GitHub (may also by bookdown.org). We'll call this book "BB".

**1) Start on local computer**

1. Copy folder "D:\R\bookdown_template"(this version is from Jules32, much easier than Yihui's bookdown-demo) to a reasonable place
1. Rename 2 things from "bookdown_template" to "BB":
    - the folder itself
    - the .Rproj file
1. Double-click the .Rproj file to launch RStudio 
1. Click on the Build tab in the top right pane to build book
    
**2) Create "BB" GitHub repo**

1. Go to your GitHub account: github.com/username
1. Click on Repositories, and the green button "New" to create a new repo
1. Name this new repo "BB" (DO NOT initialize this repo with a README)
1. Click the green "create repository" button, then copy URL

**3) Turn "bookdown_template" into "BB"**

1. Go back to RStudio, to your "BB" project
1. In the Console, type `usethis::use_git()` and say Yes to the two prompts. This will restart R and give you a new Git tab in the upper right pane.
1. Now, click on the Terminal tab next to the Console tab. 
1. Type `git remote add origin URL`
1. Type `git push --set-upstream origin master`

**4) Publish "BB" (Last step)**

1. Refresh github, then files should be there! 
1. Click Settings
1. Scroll down to GitHub Pages, click "Check it out here"
1. Change the Source pulldown from "None" to "master branch /docs folder"
1. It should say "Your site is ready to be published at https://username.github.io/BB/"

**5) Write local .Rmd, build and update online book in Github**

1. Rstudio to build(knitr) the whole book, including all .Rmd files
    - In Build panel, click "Build Book"
    - or in Console, type `rmarkdown::render_site(encoding = 'UTF-8')`
1. In Git panel, select all files, click Commit, appears a new window
1. Input "XX changes", click Commit
1. Finally, click Push -> Done!

PS: we ignore Travis and related continuous integration(持续部署) here, actually now Yihui uses Makefile and _render.R [instead](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown/tree/main/inst/examples). 

**6) Adding chapters and citations**

1. 

## Best single page (template)

In case we don't need a book, but a single page. 
This is YAML header used in .Rmd, with output a single HTML. 
The template robobook is great for reading. 
```
---
title: "啊啊啊"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
output:
  rmdformats::robobook:
    code_folding: show
    self_contained: true
    default_style: "light"
    downcute_theme: "default"
---
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## Global options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```
```
