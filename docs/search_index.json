In cases where data are collected for the purpose other than research, you might not need to submit an ethics application. This might be the case if your project falls into one of the following categories of data collection or use: Archival data, if it is from a public domain Please note, you will have to apply for ethics approval if the information you intend to use is identified personal information (states or implies identity), not in a public domain or if you will collect data in addition to the archival research. Administrative data collection Collection of data from staff or other stakeholders for the purposes of informing or improving a process within your organisation is not considered research. Still, if you later decide to use this data for research purposes, you will need to apply for ethics approval. In addition, the use of identified data always requires ethics approval. Teaching and learning If you collect human data solely for teaching or learning purposes and do not expect to publish or present any data, no ethics application is necessary. However, if you think the project may be published, it is recommended that you apply for ethics approval before running the project, as this is easier than getting approval subsequently. Quality assurance or clinical audit Usually data collected for quality assurance purposes or an audit, does not require ethical review, if it is for your organisations own information. However, if information is to be taken outside the organisation and used for a published paper, research project etc, this is considered research and requires ethical review. Negligible risk research involving collections of non-identifiable data Your research involves negligible risk if you use existing non-identifiable data or records or if it does not involve any foreseeable risk of harm or discomfort, which means there must not be the possibility of anything more than inconvenience. Although in this case you are not required to apply for ethics approval, you will probably need to complete a form to confirm that the project is of negligible risk, and provide a letter (or similar evidence of approval) from the person in charge of the data. 1.2 2010-2012 1.2.1 825 2012 2012-08-09  Win episcope  error bar chart 84-91-205 Approximately=a number of=some  me 0404142385 bao 0404151559 PassPort: G55112399 1/28 FORSYTH STREET, Kingsford, NSW, 2032 2816 chengxiang Essays on Physicians Choice Changes in drug utilization following the outpatient prescription drug cost-sharing programevidence from Chinas Win episcope  error bar chart 84-91-205 Approximately=a number of=some bao 0404151559 PassPort: G55112399  1/28 FORSYTH STREET, Kingsford, NSW, 2032 13540617813 LCAmodelschoice model, class membership model R BayesLCAlatent class model White, A. and T.

They assume that if you insure the uninsured or give people more generous coverage that they will all get more health care without ever asking: who is going to provide that extra care? Purports to control total spending on physician services, but it controls only prices, even though spending is the product of the price and the number and intensity of services. Weve seen that diagnostic imaging costs more in the U.S than elsewhere, but what about physician fees? This is arguably the most subjective part of the health care system. For example, do some countries value their physicians more than others?

Becker  There are 6 features which contribute to the benefits on a popoulations health, associated with primary care. (Starfield et al., 2005) These benefits are improved access to services, improved quality of care, more emphasis on prevention, early management of health problems, combined effect of primary care delivery characteristics and the role of primary care in reducing unnecessary and potentially harmful specialist care. (Starfield et al., 2005) General practice was first introduced into parts of urban China in 1999. (Liu, 2005) CHC was introduced in 1998. (Pan et al., 2006) a major determinant of a patients satisfaction with care provided is their initial expectations, which can be shaped by a number of variables, including socio-demographic and socioeconomic factors, past experience, needs, and word-of-mouth influence. (Tam, 2007)Recently research seeking to understand patients perspectives has moved from asking about patient satisfaction, which can be difficult to interpret to enquiring about patient experiences with healthcare. (Davies and Cleary, 2005) The John Hopkins PCATs four main domains assess the structure and process of primary care service provision The John Hopkins Primary Care Assessment Tool was selected for use to assess patients experience of quality. Measuring patient experience of quality rather than patient satisfaction was a key feature when choosing the research instrument, given increasing dissatisfaction with measuring patient satisfaction, due to difficulty in interpreting patient satisfaction results. (Berendsen et al., 2009; Davies and Cleary, 2005) As part of the calculation of sub domain scores a score of 9 - not sure, was converted to a score of 2.5 for all sub-domains, except comprehensiveness, where a score of 9-not sure was converted to 0. Instead, during the interviews the research assistant conducted the interview and the translator translated the main points of the interview as the interview was ongoing. This allowed the opportunity to ask some questions as the interview progressed.

This will restart R and give you a new Git tab in the upper right pane. Now, click on the Terminal tab next to the Console tab. Type git remote add origin URL Type git push --set-upstream origin master 4) Publish BB (Last step) Refresh github, then files should be there!
