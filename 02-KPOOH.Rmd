## Value-based healthcare(VBH)

### What is value-based healthcare?

1. Elizabeth Koff, the Secretary for NSW Health, has a speech: 
  1. better value care is one of the key strategic priorities for our NSW health system going forward
  1. Value-based healthcare is a contemporary model of care where health systems put the patient values(experience+outcomes) at the centre of the care we deliver
  1. It's not about cost-cutting. It's about appropriate care, It's about not doing unnecessary procedures. It's about doing the right things that achieve the best outcomes for the patients with the most efficient and effective price.

## VBH in NSW

1. NSW's priority programs currently accelerating our move to VBH are:
  - [Leading Better Value Care](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Value/Pages/leading-better-value-care.aspx) - identifying and scaling evidence based initiatives statewide for specific conditions.
  - [Integrated Care](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/integratedcare/Pages/default.aspx) - statewide strategies to coordinate care and processes within the health system and with other service providers.
  - [Commissioning for Better Value](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Value/Pages/commissioning-for-better-value.aspx) - shifting focus on non-clinical and clinical support projects from outputs to outcomes.
  - [Collaborative Commissioning](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Value/Pages/collaborative-commissioning.aspx) - whole-of-system approach to incentivise local autonomy and accountability for delivering patient-centred and outcome-focused care in the ommunity.

## How to develop a DCE embeded VBH? 

The most challenging part of this DCE is to create a choice context where our respondents would understand value based care and make choices based on such principles. In [Yuanyuan's JHE paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167629618309573?via%3Dihub#sec0080), the choice context is to choose between funding treatment A and funding treatment B for Australian Medicare based on five criteria. Essentially we asked them to made a decision on which group of patientsâ€™ lives are more valuable.
